CameraKombat
============

Camera Kombat is an opensource fighting game based on computer vision that enables free, unencumbered interaction. In order to enable this level of interaction, images of the users are captured via webcam and their gestures are recognized in real-time.

This is a new implementation of a project created in 2006 (http://sourceforge.net/projects/camera-kombat).

The original version was implemented in C, with OpenCV + OpenGL.

Goals of this project
---------------------

- Implementation in Python, with OpenCV (cv2 + numpy) + PyGame
- Support for multiple segmentation methods
